# Resume-checker

During this hackathon, I developed an Automated Resume Relevance Check System that evaluates how well a candidate’s resume matches a job description. The main idea was to create a tool that not only checks for keyword matches but also understands the resume content intelligently using modern AI techniques. I implemented two scoring modes: a simple keyword-based match for a quick and lightweight evaluation, and an LLM-powered mode using OpenAI’s GPT models to provide a smarter, structured assessment of skills, education, experience, and overall relevance.

The project focuses on making the evaluation process fast, accurate, and easy to use. Users can upload resumes in PDF, DOCX, or TXT format, paste a job description, and immediately see a relevance score along with matched skills and suggestions to improve the resume. For the LLM mode, I carefully designed prompts to extract structured information and reasoning from the model, so the output is clear, understandable, and actionable.

Overall, this project reflects my thinking about practical AI applications: combining classical methods like keyword matching with modern generative AI to solve real-world problems efficiently. It helped me strengthen my problem-solving mindset, my skills in Streamlit deployment, text extraction, and LLM integration, and it gave me hands-on experience creating a tool that could realistically be used in hiring processes.
